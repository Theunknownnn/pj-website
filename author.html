        Rick Riordan is a famous Author, but how did he do it? His first series (Percy Jackson and the Olympians) was about greek mythology but in the modern era. Following a 12 year old called Percy Jackson who is son of Poseidon but also son of a mortal who are these people called? Demigods or Half-bloods. Monsters such as the Minotuar can smell and hunt down these "Demigods". It was a huge success in which he then made another series called : The Kane Chronicles based on Ancient Egyption Gods. He also made : The Heroes Of Olympus based around greek mythology but this time with the romans.

        Rick Riordan books are without doubt one of if not the best books to ever hit the shelfs. Filled with Greek Mythology all the way to Norse mythology! briding that gap from Greek Mythology to Roman beliefs (Lets be honest roman and greek? Basically the same religion) giving a wonderful experiences for the reader! If you're still not convinced go read it yourself!
